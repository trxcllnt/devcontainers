# RAPIDS [devcontainers](https://containers.dev/)

This repository contains features and workflows for building development containers to support local dev and CI for NVIDIA [RAPIDS](https://github.com/rapidsai), [CCCL](https://github.com/nvidia/cccl), and [Legate](https://github.com/nv-legate).

We've chosen to use a monorepo, but it is similar in spirit to the official [devcontainers/features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features) and [devcontainers/images](https://github.com/devcontainers/images) repositories.

### For details on using the RAPIDS devcontainers, see [`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md).

### For details on contributing to this repository, see [`DEVELOP.md`](DEVELOP.md).

### See the list of `rapidsai/devcontainers` tags [on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rapidsai/devcontainers/tags).
